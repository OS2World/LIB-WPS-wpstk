* Module Name: excluded.c
*
* Dummy sourcefile to name APIs for bin\checktest.cmd that are currently
* and/or possibly never will be tested  by the sample programs.
*
* Testing of the following APIs is not possible or not intended:
*
*    WtkInitializeNumSpinbuttonArray
*    WtkQueryNumSpinbuttonIndex
*    WtkQueryGUIControlsChanged
*    WtkReboot
*    WtkIsFontAvailable
*    WtkSetWindowFont
*
* The following APIs are already used internally by WPSTK library code
* and maybe included in samples at a later point of time:
*    WtkFilterEntryField
*    WtkQueryClassIndex
*    WtkSetErrorInfo
*    WtkValidateObjectValueTable
*    WtkGetStringDrawLen
