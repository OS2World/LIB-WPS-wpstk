This is a sample text, which is bound both to
a 16-bit and a 32.bit exe file as an external
data object. It can easily be referenced via
the data structure BINDATA, which automatically
handles the different layout for the 16/32-bit
binary data object and its preceeding length field,
which is 16/32-bit in size, corresponding to the
chosen memory model.
